1. Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like
monopoly would be like, if there was no software on a central server.

Consider
What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
How could people cheat ?
How could you prevent them from cheating ?

2. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move
towards decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other
cryptocurrencies?


Answers
1. The essential pieces of functionality are:
- The board
- The pieces
- The dice
- The rules
- The money
- The players

People could cheat by changing any one piece of functionality. 
For example, they could change the rules so that they get more money when they pass go. 
Or they could change the money so that they get more money when they pass go.
Or they could change the dice so that they always roll a six. 
Or they could change the board so that they can move to any square they want. 
Or they could change the pieces so that they can move to any square they want. 
Or they could change the players abilities so that they can move to any square they want or receives a discount on rent.

You could prevent them from cheating by making the pieces of functionality decentralised.
For example, you could make the pieces of functionality into smart contracts on a blockchain.
Then the rules would be enforced by the smart contract, which would be immutable and self-exectuing.
Each transaction would be recorded on the blockchain, so it would be impossible to cheat because
the blockchain would be the source of truth and verifiable by all players.

2. CBDCs are currencies issued by central banks that are digital, for example, the digital yuan.
They will help adoption of other cryptocurrencies because they will make people more comfortable with digital currencies, but
they are not decentralised because they are issued by a single entity, the central bank.
With the digital yuan, the central bank can see all transactions, but not the public therefore it is not transparent and verifiable by all.
Meaning, the central bank can censor transactions (ex. funding an overseas war) and change the rules at any time (ex. people from a certain region can not execute transaction).
Therefore, CBDCs are not a move towards decentralisation, but may help with the adoption of other cryptocurrencies.
