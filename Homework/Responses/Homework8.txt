1. The DEX design can differ between Solana and Ethereum in the following ways:
    - Solana is faster than Ethereum, so the DEX can be faster.
    - Solana is cheaper than Ethereum, so the DEX can be cheaper.
    - Solana has a different programming language than Ethereum, so the DEX can be written in a different language.
    - Solana has a different consensus mechanism than Ethereum, so the DEX can be designed differently.

2. The features I would look for in selecting a wallet are mobile compatibility, ease of use, and security. Currently the easiest way to interact
    with dApps on mobile are within the wallet's internal browser, so I would look for a wallet that has a good internal browser with a clean UI.
    I would also look for a wallet that has a good reputation and has been around for a while, so that I can be sure that my funds are safe. Ideally, I would
    prefer the wallet's code to be open-source, however this is not a requirement.

3. I believe Solflare has all of these capabilities currently. It is open-source, has a mobile app, and has a browser extension. It also has a clean UI and is easy to use.
    However, it is only available on Solana, so it does not have multi-chain support.

4. I currently use Phantom wallet, it is currently not open-source, but it is Multi-Chain which allows me to utilize it for Ethereum and Solana dApps. It also
    has a clean UI and is easy to use.

5. The token functionality design process is different on Solana because all tokens are SPL-Tokens
